My ACM-ICPC algorithm book (in Python)
======================================

    /!\ Caution:
        Since I don't have the full test case, there might be some bugs.
        If you have full test case & answer sheet, please raise an issue.

This is an algorithm book, so it will only give out a (rundable) outline of each questions.

Test Program
------------

- Python 3

    $ python3 probname.py < probname.in

- Haskell

    $ ghc probname.hs
    $ ./probname < probname.in

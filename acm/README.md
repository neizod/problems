My ACM-ICPC algorithm book (in Python)
======================================

    /!\ Caution:
        Since I don't have the full test case, there might be some bugs.
        If you have full test case & answer sheet, please raise an issue for it.

This is an algorithm book, so it will only give out an outline of each questions.

Problems souce & sort from:

To test program:

    $ python3 probname.py < probname.in

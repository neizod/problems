My ACM-ICPC algorithm book (in Python)
======================================

    /!\ Caution:
        Since I don't have the full test case, there might be some bugs.
        If you have full test case & answer sheet, please raise an issue for it.

This is an algorithm book, so it will only give out a (rundable) outline of each questions (in Python).

Problems source & sort from: <http://acm.zju.edu.cn/onlinejudge/showProblemsets.do>

To test program:

    $ python3 probname.py < probname.in

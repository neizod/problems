ACM-ICPC
========

Ok, now ACM did accept Python, as so many online judge.
Now I'm capable of Python and C++, so the solution may be vary in langauges.

Caution: there may be some Python codes that not fast enough to pass the test,
or cause run time error since it's too old to test against the judge.

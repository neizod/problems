Problems Solving
================

    /!\ Caution:
        Reading through this solutions might be spoiling yourself.

This repository contains my (public) problem-solving solutions.

All programs are written in Python for the sake of readbilities.

Optimized version or other programming paradigm might exists in other languages, like C, Haskell, Brainfuck, etc.

Test Program
------------

If any, input from `stdin` will be provide with `input.in` file. Look out for some problems that I might not provide `input.in` myself -- such as in Code Jam directory. You can find the input from their site.

- Python: all for `python3`, somes might compatible with `python2` and `pypy`.

        $ python3 problem-name.py                       # no input from stdin
        $ python3 problem-name.py < problem-name.in     # w/ input from stdin

- Haskell: I do recommend to compile and run, not `runhaskell`.

        $ ghc -O2 problem-name.hs
        $ ./problem-name

After test programs, you might want to run `git clean -df`.
